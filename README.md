 ford go bike rides Dataset
Summary: the dataset is collection of bike rides in many different start and end stations, bike_id, member_birth_year, user_type and duration_sec is the most intrested variable.
I'm interested in how duration varies and who are likely to ride more.
I cleaned the data from null and duplicated values to retain data effectiveness

Data exploration
1- users are increasing as members are younger
2- we got more subscriber user types
3- males are the most common gender
4- younger members ride more duration

Explanatory analysis
1 - 2001 birth year has the hight average duration
2 - Subscriber duration of rides time is longer than any hour at 2 AM, 3 AM
3 - Customer duration of rides time is longer than any hour at 3 AM, 4 AM
